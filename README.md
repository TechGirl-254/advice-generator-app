## Overview
If you're reading this, it means you are a wise fellow. Seeking advice from outside yourself, looking to the universe for answers, and answers you will find.

Haha. Sorry for the dramatic intro, and welcome to Advice Generator, an app that helps you get random advice from the internet.

I developed this App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### What I learned

Wow!! There is so much I learnt, but I will start with what caught my interest the most.

React-Type-Animation: For the longest time, I have been using csws to try and come up with animations. Not because I didn't know other options exist, but because I felt it would be an interesting way to understand deeper CSS concepts. But with this projecvt, I had to use React-Type-Animation to get slidding texts, and it was amazing how much React can do compared to pure CSS. I gues that's why its a framewoork, haha!

Adding a Social Media Share Feature: This preoject also helped me discover how to add social media icons that allow users to share the advice they get from the app. I didn't know about the links, and how to get the icons, and how to create and render components for them, but now I do.
### Continued development

I will continue to develop the Social Media share icons. Due to time constaraints I was unable to make them work effectively,. but this leaves room for more learning and improvement, which i absolutely love.

### Useful resources

- https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ - This helped me alot with understanding cSS styling options, especially, sizing, Display, Flex, and Responsiveness with media querries.
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-share - I would reccomend this for anyone trying to learn how to work with social media share icons.
- https://blog.logrocket.com/3-ways-implement-typing-animation-react/ - This site was also very helpful for the react anoimation concepts.
